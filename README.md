**I used MediaPlayer for audio management. For commercial project I will use JSON for getting the urls of music, image and name, genre of the song from our server. Will save them in a array of strings. After this we will able to make catagories and music list. Then using MediaPlayer we will able to control song management. Then with next button we will pass to next url(song) and prev button will send to previous url(song). Play button will load last played song.**
